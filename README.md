# WotC_Gameplay_Misc_WeaponGunsmith

Introducing Weapon Gunsmith, as seen in AAA titles such as Metro: Exodus, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare I (2019) and II (2022). You can customize almost all aspects of your weapon, down to the receiver. This is a framework mod for modders that allows other mods to hook their custom weapons into Weapon Gunsmith as they see fit. This mod does nothing on its own.
